# GoRoute

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a mobile application that helps users find optimal taxi routes. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for inputting pickup and drop-off locations, display various route options, and offer estimated fare calculations. Our goal is to enhance the taxi-hailing experience by providing transparency and efficiency in route planning.

Features
User-Facing Features
Intuitive User Interface: A clean and easy-to-navigate design for seamless interaction.

Location Input:

Manual Address Entry: Users can type in pickup and drop-off addresses.

Map Selection: Users can select locations directly on an interactive map.

Autocomplete Suggestions: Real-time suggestions for addresses as the user types.

Route Calculation & Display:

Multiple Route Options: Displaying various routes (e.g., fastest, shortest, traffic-aware).

Real-time Traffic Updates: Incorporate live traffic data to provide accurate route estimations.

Turn-by-Turn Navigation (Optional): Once a route is selected, offer turn-by-turn guidance.

Estimated Fare Calculation:

Based on distance, estimated time, and potentially dynamic pricing (e.g., surge pricing).

Breakdown of fare components (base fare, per km/minute charges, tolls, etc.).

Taxi Availability (Future Feature): Display nearby available taxis.

Ride History: Users can view their past trips, including route, fare, and driver details (if applicable).

User Profile: Allow users to manage their personal information.

SOS Button (Optional Safety Feature): For emergencies during a ride.

Driver-Facing Features (Future Expansion)
Driver Registration & Verification: Secure onboarding process for drivers.

Trip Acceptance/Management: Drivers can accept, start, and end trips.

In-App Navigation: Turn-by-turn directions for drivers.

Earnings Tracking: Drivers can view their trip earnings.

Admin Panel Features (Future Expansion)
User and Driver Management: Manage user and driver accounts.

Fleet Management: Monitor taxi locations and status.

Pricing Configuration: Set up base fares, per-kilometer rates, and surge pricing rules.

Analytics and Reporting: Gain insights into app usage, popular routes, and revenue.

Technology Stack
Frontend (Mobile Application)
Framework: React Native or Flutter (for cross-platform compatibility)

UI/UX Libraries: Appropriate UI component libraries for the chosen framework.

Backend
Language/Framework: Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), or Ruby on Rails

Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL (for storing user data, ride history, etc.)

APIs:

Mapping & Geolocation: Google Maps API (Directions API, Distance Matrix API, Geocoding API, Places API) or Mapbox.

Real-time Capabilities: WebSockets (for live taxi tracking, if implemented).

Payment Gateway Integration: Stripe, PayPal, or a local payment provider.

Other Tools & Services
Version Control: Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

Cloud Platform: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure (for hosting backend services and database)

Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or equivalent.

Analytics: Google Analytics or a similar tool for app usage insights.
